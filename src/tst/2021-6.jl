---
This test is the first formal test on editint.
I will use the real genotype first.
This is because that the genotypes from `QMSimu` and `ms` still look wierd to me.

## Scenario to be considered
- Number of QTL, 100:450:1000
- Number of full sibs per family, 60:20:100.  Half of them are to be challenged
- number of QTL to be edited, 3, or 5 biggest in the base
  - I send a subset of the simulated QTL for editing
  - The subset is determined in the breeding program, not here.
- Correlation `r` between the QTL of the 2 traits.
- Number of sibs per full sib family
  - Always challenge half of them
- Editing vs. non editing
- Number of repeats will be as number of instances to be submitted on `Saga`.
