# Summary for meeting on 2021-April-16
## ToDo
- [x] parallele base simulation.
- [x] Multiple-trait Laplacian/Gamma
  - See discussion in separate file
- [x] Plot frequencies separately
  - or bubble size as initial MAF
  - only plot the frequency changes.
- [ ] Simulation
  - starts from one trait
- [ ] Edit maximally 3-5 QTL.
  - assume we know these 3-5 QTL
  - edit according which has the largest $2pqa^2$ in the current generation.
