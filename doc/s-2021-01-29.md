# Summary 2021-01-29
## QTL
- [x] effects use $\Gamma(0.4, \text{scale to be determined})$ distribution
  - by default of `shape = 0.4`
  - if `shape<0`, then Gaussian.
  - use $\sigma_a^2 = 2pqa^2$ to order QTL
- [x] 1000 QTL each trait

## Base simulation
- [x] Clone and make `macs`, `msformatter` in b_Update.jl
- [x] Alternative to the real data.
- Create $\sim$ 55k SNP per chromosome
  - too many maybe, need resampling.
- If ignore history structure
  - $\to \sim 7000$ SNP.
    - much faster
    - appropriate?

## GEBV module
- [ ] SNP BLUP
- [x] accumulate data, use multiple generation reference
  - [x] I/O of data of previous generations
  - [x] also include current generation data for EBV
- [ ] include fixed effects.
- [ ] more complicated methods.

## Updates
- [x] `random_mate` to guaranttee to utilize every dam.
  - and every sire if $n_{\text{sire}} \le n_{\text{dam}}$
- [x] parameters as named tuple from a dictionary.

```julia
parameters = Dict(:nSire => 15,
	          :nDam => 30)	# ...
par = (; parameters...)
func(par)			# named tuple as arguments
par.nSire			# use the argument
```

## Bug fixes
  - threshold: th = par.threshold + base.mean
  - pedigree creation
  - refactor

## Q + A
- [x] scale var(TBV) = 1 of eQTL $\sim\Gamma(0.4, 1)$
  - scale 1 will some value else after above.
- [x] rank QTL by $2pqa^2$, and $a_1$?
  - $2pqa^2$
- [x] avoid mating between close relatives?
  - ignore relationship
- [ ] include all previous generations, or set a limit?
  - RAM capacity
  - realistic issue (evironment, challenge doses, ...).
