# Summary 2021-09-21
## Simulation with independent QTL
- QTL for production and binary traits were independently sampled from the available loci.
- $n_{\mathrm{QTL}} = 100,\,500$
- QTL effect distributions: 
  - `Normal(0,1)`
  - `Laplace(0, 1)`.
- Selection methods:
	- SNP-BLUP
	- Top 10 QTL as fixed effects
	- Edit top 10 QTL in turn on their effects
- 20 repeats

## Simulation with pleiotropic QTL
- QTL for production and binary traits are the same
- $n_{\mathrm{QTL}} = 100,\,500$
- QTL effects were sampled from:
  - MvNormal([0, 0], [1 -.2; -.2 1])
  - MvNormal([0, 0], [1 0; 0 1])
  - MvNormal([0, 0], [1 .2; .2 1])
- Same slection methods
- 21 repeats
