# Meeting 2021-03-26
## Simulation with `macs`
![Using simulated base](fig/test-breeding-v4.pdf)

## Previously using a real base
![Using real genotypes](fig/test-breeding-v3.pdf)

## Editing
- Simulate a common generation zero
  - or just use the real genotypes
- Rank QTL on $2pqa^2$ in every generation
- Then compare
  - normal breeding program
  - edit biggest QTL each generation
	- with a successful rate
