# Meeting 2021-03-26
## Simulation with `macs`
![Using simulated base](fig/test-breeding-v4.pdf)

## Previously using a real base
![Using real genotypes](fig/test-breeding-v3.pdf)

## Editing
- Simulate a common generation zero
  - or just use the real genotypes
- Rank QTL on $2pqa^2$ in every generation
- Then compare
  - normal breeding program
  - edit biggest QTL each generation
	- start from generation 2
	- with a successful rate
	- edit each whole generation, for simplicity

## Testing
- Test run for editing and summary will be available after the meeting.

## Make the package public?
```julia
]  # for first time use
add https://github.com/xijiang/GEAS.jl
^h
using GEAS
using Revise
includet("a-local julia file to run simulation with GEAS")

# and later
]
update GEAS # as there are still new functions pushed up frequently.
```

## As a co-developer
- Can freely add some test codes in `src/tst`
  - of name format `tst-yy-mm-dd-author.jl`
- Similarily, you can add some markdowns in `doc/`
- This can simplify git merging management

```bash
git pull # to see if others have new codes pushed
git commit -am 'your marks'
git push origin main # to push your test into remote main
```

## Issues and function requests
- new functions will be added in `src/*.jl`.
- switch to julia v1.6.0?
