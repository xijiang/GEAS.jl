# Meeting notes 2021-01-22

## ToDo
- [x] QC-ed genotypes (Binyam), with floating SNP removed
  - `plink` option added
    - `--chr 1-29`
    - `--exclude snp.dupvar`
  - Namely all SNP of postion 0, and duplicates, including the first one were removed
  - [x] serialized base population `ns.ser` was done again.
  - $N_{\text{SNP}}$: 53,211 $\to$ 50,793.
- [x] female:male = 2
  - assuming sex of the 600 salmons can be randomly assigned.
  - make sure that the constant nuclear population size is a multiple of 3.

## ToDo - cont.
- [x] using `threshold` as the parameter for binary trait simulation.
  - the `threshold` is measured with $\sigma_p$
  - should be corrected with mean of base.
- [ ] challenge full sib percentage as parameter
- [ ] GEBV procedure $\to$ `estimation.jl`
- [ ] using only LM for the binary trait
- [ ] variable nuclear population size
- [x] Genotyping every body
- [ ] 10 generations, or as a parameter.
- [ ] `macs` for base population
