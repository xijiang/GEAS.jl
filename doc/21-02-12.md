## SNP storage
- [x] use boolean to store SNP genotypes
  - This is easy, `Int8` $\Rightarrow$ `BitArray(undef, dims)`. 
  - Memory footprint $\to$ trivial
    - capable dealing with hundreds of generations.
    - better to keep `dropping` to `Matrix{Bool}`, or, less than half the speed.
  - Also picked some speed.
  - Matrix{Int8} has range problem with GEMM.

## Another problem
- It may be better to define arrays first of max sizes, and fill later.
  - will pick up some speed also.
  - more stable program.
    - the program will be killed on a second run
    - because of unsafe genotype array copy / concatenation
    - no problem if run on generation_one 20 times
  - define storage first might solve the problem.
  - store non-SNP data in a `DataFrame` for ease of operation later.
- [x] Action: re-write the `breeding` part.
  - not trivial

## Test run of `breeding` function

## ToDo    
- [ ] `base` simulation
- [ ] SNP-BLUP
  - [ ] Add generation fixed effect in the model
- [x] A short manual on how to develop GEAS as a co-author.
- [x] Make the package ready for GE tweaks
