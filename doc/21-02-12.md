## SNP storage
- use boolean to store SNP genotypes
  - This is easy, `Int8` $\Rightarrow$ `Bool`. However,
- Speed issue, $x$ of size(50793, 1200),
  - `@time x'v`
    - Bool, $.188s$
    - Int8, $.017s$
    - Float64, $.014s$
  - `@time x'x`
    - Bool, $77.82s$, result Int64
    - Int8, $28.86s$, result Int8, range error
    - Float64, $.33s$
  - Dropping
    - Bool, $5.1s$
    - Int8, $6.6s$
    
- [ ] SNP-BLUP
- [ ] Add generation fixed effect in the model
- [ ] A short manual on how to develop GEAS as a co-author.
- [ ] Make the package ready for GE tweaks
- [ ] Parallelize `drop` function
  - Not urgent
  - may divide dropping into 10 tasks.
  - Dropping disk I/O saves most of the time.

## Another problem
- It may be better to define arrays first of max sizes, and fill later.
  - will pick up some speed also.
  - the program will be killed on a second run
    - because of unsafe genotype array copy / concatenation
    - no problem if run on generation_one 20 times
  - define first might solve the problem.
  - store them in a `DataFrame` for ease of operation later.
- [ ] Action: re-write the `breeding` part.
