# Meeting 2021 March 05
## Some tests with SNP-BLUP
- [x] SNP-BLUP, no fixed effects.
- Scenarios
  - One generation, base $\to$ generation 1
  - 200 males, 400 females
  - $\sigma_a^2 = \sigma_e^2 = 1$
  - 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 sibs for production
  - 100, 500, 1000 QTL

## Results

## Notes: column $1\cdots 5$ are correlations between
1. TBV, phenotypes; cor $\approx\sqrt{.5}\approx 0.707$
2. GEBV, TBV; using phenotype
3. GEBV, phenotypes; using phenotypes
4. GEBV, TBV; using TBV as phenotypes
5. GEBV, phenotypes; using TBV as phenotypes

## Fitting a few QTL as fix effects
- This is just not to add $\lambda$ to diagonals corresponding these QTL
- Saves a lot of matrix manipulations.

## Performance

### Before optimization
- 15 SNP-BLUP evaluations, $4520s$
- Peak memory usage $>50$GiB
  - with `Float32`, only

### After
- $\longrightarrow 3197s$
- Peak memory usage $26.1$GiB
  - Can take `Float64` now on my 64GiB desktop
  - which may be not that necessary
  - `Float32` is quite enough

## Optimization

### Memory
```julia
lhs22 = view(...)
BLAS.gemm!(...)          # save memory allocation, and matrix copying 
BLAS.gemv!(...)
```

### Speed
```julia
LAPACK.posv!(...)        # save half of the solving time. Critical !!!
# LHS is usually positive definite, for the large $\lambda$
```
- `StaticArrays` is only for matrix or vector of 100-1000 elements.
  - if OK, ~3x faster for GEMM.
  
## ToDo
- [ ] Test more fixed factors.  Urgent, next week.
- [ ] modify genotype on big QTL in sire genomes.  Urgent, next week.
- [ ] add base population simulation
- [ ] Test package `MixedModels`, maybe later.
- [ ] Along with multiple tasks.  Trivial now.
