# Summary 2021-04-09
## ToDo
- Simulate parameters to summarize
  - [ ] inbreeding, using $\mathbf{A}$
  - [x] $\sigma_a^2$ losses
  - [ ] Loci edited
  - [ ] QTL frequency
  - [ ] correlated trait, by sharing QTL
  - [x] edit after being cadidates
	- seems that my current codes are OK.

## $\lambda$ for binary trait
- h2(bin) = h2(liability)*(z^2)/(P(1-P)) where P is probability of infection; z = f(x(P)) where f(x) is Normal density function at truncation point x where x is chosen such that a fraction P is above x and (1-P) below x.
