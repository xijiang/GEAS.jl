# Summary 2021-04-09
## ToDo
- Simulate parameters to summarize
  - [x] correlated traits
	- by sharing QTL?
	- see discussion
  - [x] return also QTL genotypes
	- return all SNP of the production population in `BitArray`
  - [x] $\sigma_a^2$ losses
	- this can be summerized from `prd` returned
  - [x] edit after being cadidates
	- seems that my current codes are OK.
  - [x] using proper $\lambda$ for the binary trait
  - [ ] Summarize simulation results, on `prd`, `snp`, `qtl`
	- [ ] inbreeding, using $\mathbf{A}$
	- [ ] $\sigma_a^2$ loss
	- [ ] QTL frequencies change through generations.

## Is gamma distribution OK?
```julia
function sim_QTL(base, nqtl...; shape = 0.4)
a  = (shape < 0) ? randn(n) : rand(Gamma(0.4, 1), n)
```

## Using Laplace distribution
```julia
function sim_QTL(base, nqtl...; d = Laplace())
a = rand(d, n)
```

## Discussion
- To break the positive correlation, `Lapace()` is better than `Gamma()`.
- non-zero correlation is not a good parameter
  - can be a sum of both positive and negative shared QTL
  - can arise just out of randomness.
  - many reasons to same result
	- hence difficult to explain upstream reasons.
  - by random sampled $N_{\mathrm{shared}}$ QTL
	- May expected 0 correlation in beginning
	- much easier to explain(?)
  
## $\lambda$ for binary trait
- h2(bin) = h2(liability)*(z^2)/(P(1-P)) where P is probability of infection; z = f(x(P)) where f(x) is Normal density function at truncation point x where x is chosen such that a fraction P is above x and (1-P) below x. 

- $h_{\mathrm{bin}}^2 = \frac{h_{\mathrm{liability}}^2z^2}{p(1-p)}$, where
  - $p$ is the probability of the infection
  - $z = f(x(p))$
  - $f(x)$ is Normal density funciton at truncation point $x$, such that a fraction $p$ is above $x$ and $(1-p)$ below $x$.

## Implemetation
```julia
h2 = begin        # for the binary trait
    p = par.p8e   # percentage killed/survived
    z = pdf(Normal(), p)
    par.hÂ²[2]*z*z/(p*(1-p))   # ~0.25 here
end
```

## Inbreeding
- Two methods
- $\mathbf{A}$ matrix
  - Table method and `Float16`
  - Slow and memory greedy
- Recursive method
  - only to calculate one sib of each of the many full-sibships
  - can be parallelized just by addint `Thread.@threads`.
- $\mathbf{G}$ matrix
  ```julia
  sum(h1) + sum(h2) + 2sum(h1 .& h2)
  ```
