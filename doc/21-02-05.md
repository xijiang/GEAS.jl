# Meeting 2021-Feb-05
## ToDo
- [ ] Add generation fixed effect in the model
- [ ] A short manual on how to develop GEAS as a co-author.
- [ ] Make the package ready for GE tweaks
- [ ] Record pedigree
- [ ] Parallelize `drop` function
- [ ] Merge data of multiple generations.
  - maybe just in memory.

## Problems
- without evaluation, 10 cycles use $504s$
- Dropping and merging take most of the time.
- Evaluation will do too.
  - This, however, involves matrix operation
  - which is parallelized already.

## Bug
- [x] Pedigree for ID with production phenotypes.
